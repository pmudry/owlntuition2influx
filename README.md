# owlntuition2influx
A Python script that sends OWL Intuition LC measurements to InfluxDB, using the multicast messages from OWL. Nothing fancy here, the only thing done is some XML -> JSON transformations with data conversions for Influx.

# Requirements
Some Python version, an InfluxDB server with a database named `OWL` created.
